<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Quipper is a quantum circuit description language. It is functional
in nature, so when writing Quipper programs you can think in terms of
gates being applied in real time to qubit variables, just as you would
for a classical functional program.</p>
<p>Quipper is implemented as a domain-specific language within the
functional programming language <a
href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>. Quipper was developed at
Dalhousie University by Peter Selinger, and remains open source. Its
original goal was to to accurately estimate and reduce the computational
resources required to implement quantum algorithms on a realistic
quantum computer. It comes with a standard library implementation of 7
nontrivial reference quantum algorithms; compiling them into quantum
circuits tells you how many qubits are needed exactly.</p>
<p>This brief survey will roughly follow the article <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5485">An Introduction to Quantum
Programming in Quipper</a>. For much more information, see the <a
href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/">Quipper
homepage</a> and the official <a
href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/doc/">Quipper
documentation</a>.</p>
<h4 id="circuit-model">Circuit model</h4>
<p>Quipper can express circuits that allow both quantum and classical
wires and operations in the same circuit. Quantum operations can be
controlled by a classical wire, but not the other way around. An
explicit measurement operation turns a quantum wire into a classical
wire.</p>
<p>Quipper’s circuit model also has scope: some (ancilla) wires are only
used in part of a circuit, and may be explicitly initialised and
terminated part-way the circuit.</p>
<p>There are three distinct phases of execution:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compile time</strong>: when Quipper syntax is translated
into an executable classical program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Circuit generation time</strong>: when the resulting
classical program generated a quantum circuit. Inputs whose value is
known at this stage are called <strong>parameters</strong>. For example,
the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is really a family of circuits, one for each
natural number <code>n</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Circuit execution time</strong>: when the resulting
quantum circuit is executed on (simulated) quantum hardware. Inputs
whose value are only known at this stage are called
<strong>inputs</strong>. For example, the inputs to Deutsch-Jozsa on
<code>n</code> qubits are <span class="math inline">n</span> input
qubits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To keep the different kinds of input separate, Quipper uses three
basic types for bits and qubits.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bits</strong>: have type <code>Bool</code> at circuit
generation time, and have type <code>Bit</code> as a classical Boolean
input to a circuit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qubits</strong>: have type <code>Qubit</code> and are
only available as inputs at circuit execution time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code>Bool</code> can be converted into <code>Bit</code>, but not the
other way around. Because measurements can only occur at circuit
execution time, their outcome is a <code>Bit</code>, not a
<code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>Quipper is <strong>lazy</strong>. That is, when it evaluates a
circuit-producing function, that circuit is produced on the fly. That is
useful for very large circuits, which therefore don’t need to be stored
in memory all at once. Circuits can also be consumed lazily.</p>
<h4 id="embedded-language">Embedded language</h4>
<p>Quipper is implemented as an embedded language within the host
language Haskell, and the quipper compiler is really a wraparound for
the Haskell compiler. Hence, Quipper really is a collection of data
types, combinators, and functions within Haskell. However, not every
Haskell program is a good Quipper program, and there is a preferred
style of writing Quipper programs. If you don’t adhere to that style,
there is no guarantee that Quipper acts as expected. Because of this
more or less mandated programming style, you can also think of Quipper
as a language in its own right, without thinking about Haskell.</p>
<h4 id="primitive-operations">Primitive operations</h4>
<p>Here is a very simple Quipper function:</p>
<pre><code>plus_minus :: Bool -&gt; Circ Qubit
plus_minus b = do
  q &lt;- qinit b
  r &lt;- hadamard q
  return r</code></pre>
<p>The first line is the type of the function. You could in fact leave
it out, and the Quipper compiler will infer it. But for now it’s useful
to see that the input to the function is a boolean parameter. The output
type <code>Circ Qubit</code> says that the function results in a circuit
that returns a single qubit. The body of the function uses three
operations, that are evaluated in the given order. First, a variable
<code>q</code> of type <code>Qubit</code> is initialised with value
<code>b</code>. Here, <code>False</code> corresponds to <span
class="math inline">\ket{0}</span> and <code>True</code> corresponds to
<span class="math inline">\ket{1}</span>. Then, a <code>hadamard</code>
operator is applied to the qubit, resulting in a new qubit
<code>r</code>. Finally, <code>r</code> is returned as the output of the
whole function.</p>
<p>You could evaluate this function as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import Quipper
main = print_simple PDF (plus_minus False)</code></pre>
<p>To obtain the following circuit as a PDF file:</p>
<p><img src="img/quipper-simple.png" /></p>
<p>Apart from the built-in function <code>hadamard</code>, you also have
<code>qnot</code> for the <span class="math inline">X</span> gate, and
the infix operator <code>'controlled'</code>, that turns any operation
into a controlled one. This code:</p>
<pre><code>share :: Qubit -&gt; Circ (Qubit, Qubit)
share a = do
  b &lt;- qinit False
  b &lt;- qnot b &#39;controlled&#39; a
  return (a,b)</code></pre>
<p>gives a 2-qubit circuit, where the second qubit is initialised <span
class="math inline">\ket{0}</span>, and a single CNOT gate is applied,
that is, a circuit for the function <span
class="math inline">\alpha\ket{0}+\beta\ket{1} \mapsto \alpha\ket{00} +
\beta\ket{11}</span>.</p>
<p>To <strong>measure</strong> a qubit, there is a function
<code>measure</code>:</p>
<pre><code>measurement :: Qubit -&gt; Circ Bit
measurement q = do
  x &lt;- measure q
  return x</code></pre>
<p>If you no longer need a measurement result, or any other
<code>Bit</code>, you can discard it:</p>
<pre><code>cdiscard x</code></pre>
<h3 id="deutsch-jozsa">Deutsch-Jozsa</h3>
<p>The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can now be written in Quipper as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>deutschjozsa :: (Qubit -&gt; Qubit -&gt; Qubit -&gt; Circ (Qubit, Qubit, Qubit)) 
                -&gt; Circ (Bit, Bit)
deutschjozsa (oracle) = do
  x &lt;- qinit False
  y &lt;- qinit False
  z &lt;- qinit True
  hadamard x
  hadamard y
  hadamard z
  (x,y,z) &lt;- oracle x y z
  hadamard x
  hadamard y
  (a,b) &lt;- measure (x,y)
  return (a,b)</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>oracle</code> is a function of type
<code>Qubit -&gt; Qubit -&gt; Qubit -&gt; Circ (Qubit, Qubit, Qubit)</code>;
a circuit that turns 3 input qubits into 3 output qubits. Unlike in
OpenQASM, we can feed the Quipper version of <code>deutschjozsa</code>
any such function we like. It could be, as before:</p>
<pre><code>oracle x y z = do
  qnot_at z `controlled` [x, y]
  return (x,y,z)</code></pre>
<p>But it could also be any other function <code>oracle</code> of the
right type.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-mechanisms">Advanced mechanisms</h3>
<p>Let us briefly touch on some of the more advanced mechanisms that
Quipper offers.</p>
<h4 id="quantum-data-types">Quantum data types</h4>
<p>From the basic data types <code>Bit</code> and <code>Qubit</code>,
you can build up more complicated data types, using tuples and lists.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(Qubit,[Qubit])</code> is a type whose elements are pairs of a
qubit and a list of qubits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every quantum data types has an associated classical data type, in
this case <code>(Bit,[Bit])</code>, and an associated boolean data type,
in this case <code>(Bool,[Bool])</code>.</p>
<h4 id="generic-functions">Generic functions</h4>
<p>The power of functional programming in Quipper comes to the fore with
generic functions. We already saw <code>measure</code>,
<code>cdiscard</code>, and <code>print_simple</code>. These are
functions that can accept inputs of many different types. We won’t go
into detail here, but for an example, here is a generic version of the
<code>plus_minus</code> function above:</p>
<pre><code>plus_minus_generic a = do
  qs &lt;- qinit a
  qs &lt;- mapUnitary hadamard qs
  return qs</code></pre>
<p>This function does not just apply to <code>Bool</code>, but can also
produce, for example, a circuit of type <code>(Qubit,[Qubit])</code> out
of <code>(Bool,[Bool])</code>.</p>
<h4 id="recursion">Recursion</h4>
<p>In Quipper you can write circuit-producing functions that are
recursive over any parameters known at circuit generation time. So, for
example, you can recurse over a list of qubits. For a nice recursive
implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform, see <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5485">An Introduction to Quantum
Programming in Quipper</a>.</p>
<h4 id="circuit-operations">Circuit operations</h4>
<p>You can also write functions that take a circuit, say of type
<code>Circ [Qubit]</code>, and make new circuits based on it. For
example, repeating a circuit a number of times, or reversing a circuit,
or use a given circuit as a subcircuit in a larger circuit.</p>
<p>Finally, any classical reversible function can be turned into a
circuit automatically by Quipper. Write a function such as</p>
<pre><code>reversiblefunction :: (Bool, Bool, Bool) -&gt; (Bool, Bool, Bool)
reversiblefunction x y z = y z x</code></pre>
<p>and then turn it into a circuit by using the operation
<code>build_circuit</code> just before:</p>
<pre><code>build_circuit
reversiblefunction :: (Bool, Bool, Bool) -&gt; (Bool, Bool, Bool)
reversiblefunction x y z = y z x</code></pre>
<h4 id="semantics">Semantics</h4>
<p>Quipper is one of few quantum programming languages with well-founded
semantics. Haskell is well-studied academically, and many of its
mathematical models extend to Quipper. For example, the crucial
<code>Circ</code> construction is in fact a <a
href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad">monad</a>. However, some aspects
of Quipper that would be useful for a quantum programming language are
not well reflected in Haskell:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependent types</strong>: Haskell has no mechanism to
recognise that a parameter of type <code>Bool</code> is available at
circuit generation time, but a <code>Bit</code> is only used at circuit
execution time.</li>
<li><strong>Linear types</strong>: qubits cannot be copied or deleted,
but terms of any Haskell type can.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a family of descendants of Quipper, called <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13041">Proto-Quipper</a>, that aim to
make Quipper a standalone language and semantics to remedy these
issues.</p>
