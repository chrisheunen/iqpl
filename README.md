The "Introduction to Quantum Computing and Semantics" course will involve several quantum programming languages. Here we can develop the lecture notes, lab instructions, and other files to prepare the course delivery. The course descriptor and Learn site is here:
  https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_98290_1/cl/outline.

We want to cover the languages:
* OpenQASM
* Qiskit
* Q#
* Quipper
* Quantomatic
* PyZX
We want to:
* Compare and contrast each
* Have a small tutorial for each, including how to set it up easily (maybe by providing a ready-to-go zip file)
* Write the same 'hello world' program in each, maybe a simple circuit
* Write the same more interesting example in each, maybe Deutsch-Jozsa or Grover

Needs to fit in half an hour a week, for 9 weeks.

Also, need to develop enough material for 2 labs for students to have a go.
(Can reuse Quantumatic and PyZX material from last years.)
