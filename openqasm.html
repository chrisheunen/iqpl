<h1 class="title">Introduction to Quantum Programming Languages</h1>
</header>
<h1 id="openqasm">OpenQASM</h1>
<p>OpenQASM is a circuit description language developed with near-term
applications in mind, i.e., to program the (small and noisy) quantum
computers we have today. Its main goal is to serve as an intermediate
representation for higher-level compilers in order to interact with
quantum hardware. For example, it can be used to interact with IBM’s <a
href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum">quantum computers</a> or Amazon’s <a
href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum">Braket</a>, although as we shall see
in future notes, higher-level languages are also available for this task
that use OpenQASM as a compilation target.</p>
<p>That it is a circuit description language means that OpenQASM
programs are not meant to be run directly on a quantum computer.
Instead, an OpenQASM program is run on a classical computer to produce a
quantum circuit, which can then be handed off to a quantum computer for
execution.</p>
<p>But why go through all of this trouble if, in the end, all we’re
doing is describing quantum circuits?</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons why this can be beneficial:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Abstraction:</strong> In a circuit, a single line denotes
a single qubit, and its precise location matters to the operation of the
circuit. In OpenQASM, variables are used to represent (collections of)
qubits, and can be given descriptive names to better relay their
intended use, and declared in any order. The precise mapping of
variables to qubits (known as <em>routing</em>) in a circuit is handled
by the OpenQASM compiler. Compile-time constants can also be used to
describe algorithms that are flexible regarding the number of qubits
available, such as those for qubit arithmetic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Typing:</strong> Variables (and subroutines, see below)
must be declared along with their types, such as <code>qubit</code> (a
qubit), <code>bit</code> (a classical bit), <code>qubit[4]</code> (an
array of four qubits), <code>int[16]</code> (a classical 16-bit
integer), and so on. This can not only be used to catch errors in
programming, but can also be used by the OpenQASM compiler to improve
the quality of the quantum circuit it produces.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Structure:</strong> Larger programs are typically written
by in a structured fashion by combining smaller parts using things like
conditionals, loops, and subroutines. Programming in this style greatly
improves the ability to read, understand, and debug a program, even as
it grows quite large. You will notice that quantum (or classical)
circuits do not support either of these features (we say that they are
<em>unstructured</em>), but OpenQASM does, with the OpenQASM compiler
able to compile these down to quantum circuits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will likely recognise these as recurring themes in the other
languages that we will look at later.</p>
<p>In what follows, we give a brief overview of the core of the
language. The full documentation can be found at <a
href="https://openqasm.com/index.html">https://openqasm.com/index.html</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>
<p>OpenQASM is an imperative and statically-typed language. Statements
are separated by semi-colons and whitespace is ignored.</p>
<h4 id="data-types-and-variable-declaration">Data types and variable
declaration</h4>
<p>Unsurprisingly, OpenQASM has types for declaring bits and qubits, as
well as registers of bits and registers of qubits:</p>
<pre><code>bit b;
bit[5] b_reg;

qubit q;
qubit[5] q_reg;</code></pre>
<p>Note that registers have a fixed size and cannot be resized after
declaration.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize at this point that qubits cannot be
initialised in the same statement as their declaration. In fact, the
only built-in way to initialise a qubit is with the special statement
<code>reset</code>, which sets the qubit to the 0 computational basis
state:</p>
<pre><code>qubit q;
reset q;</code></pre>
<h4 id="unitary-quantum-gates">Unitary quantum gates</h4>
<p>Unitary quantum operations on qubits are refered to as gates. There
is only a single built-in gate, <code>U</code>. It parametrises a
single-qubit unitary as a rotation of the Bloch sphere of the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
    U(a,b,c) = \begin{pmatrix}
      cos(a/2) &amp; -e^{ic} sin(a/2) \\
      e^{ib} sin(a/2) &amp; e^{i(b+c)} cos(a/2)
    \end{pmatrix}
</span></p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>qubit q;
reset q;
U(pi,0,pi) q;</code></pre>
<p>enacts a Pauli X gate on the qubit <code>q</code>. Since
<code>q</code> was reset to the 0 basis state, <code>q</code> is then in
the 1 basis state at the end of the program.</p>
<p>Since in common quantum circuits, the same gate can be applied many
times, it would be cumbersome to use this syntax for each identical
call. OpenQASM therefore provides a construct for abstracting gate
names: the <a
href="https://openqasm.com/language/gates.html"><code>gate</code>
block</a>. For example,</p>
<pre><code>gate X a {
   U(pi, 0, pi) a;
}</code></pre>
<p>abstracts the Pauli X gate used above, while</p>
<pre><code>gate H a {
   U(pi/2, 0, pi) a;
}</code></pre>
<p>constructs a Hadamard gate.</p>
<p>Controlled gates can be constructed by adding a <code>ctrl</code>
modifier to a pre-existing gate:</p>
<pre><code>ctrl @ U(a,b,c) q_reg[0], q_reg[1];</code></pre>
<p>Formally speaking, this implements the gate <span
class="math inline">1 \oplus U(a,b,c)</span>. This can then be
abstracted using the <code>gate</code> block:</p>
<pre><code>gate CX a, b {
   ctrl @ U(pi, 0, pi) a, b;
}

CX q_reg[0], q_reg[1];</code></pre>
<p>constucts and runs a quantum controlled-NOT or CX gate.</p>
<p>For instance, here is a simple circuit for generating a Bell
state:</p>
<pre><code>gate H a {
   U(pi/2, 0, pi) a;
}

gate CX a, b {
   ctrl @ U(pi, 0, pi) a, b;
}

qubit[2] q_reg;
reset q_reg;

H q_reg[0];
CX q_reg[0], q_reg[1];</code></pre>
<p>The resulting state is the Bell state <span class="math display">
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{00} + \ket{11})
</span></p>
<h4 id="measurements-and-classical-control">Measurements and classical
control</h4>
<p>Finally, measurements are programmed with the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>bit b; 
qubit q;
reset q;

b = measure q;</code></pre>
<p>This performs a measurement of the qubit <code>q</code> in the
computational basis. The bit <code>b</code> can then be used to control
future quantum gates with standard classical control flow: <a
href="https://openqasm.com/language/classical.html#if-else-statements">if-else</a>
statements, <a
href="https://openqasm.com/language/classical.html#for-loops">for</a>
loops, and <a
href="https://openqasm.com/language/classical.html#while-loops">while</a>
loops.</p>
<p>Finally, here is a circuit for quantum teleportation, which assembles
all of these constructs:</p>
<pre><code>gate H a {
   U(pi/2, 0, pi) a;
}

gate X {
   U(pi, 0, pi) a;
}

gate Z {
   U(0, 0, pi) a;
}

gate CX a, b {
   ctrl @ U(pi, 0, pi) a, b;
}

qubit input_state;
reset input_state;

// Create a Bell state
qubit[2] bell_state;
reset bell_state;
H bell_state[0];
CX bell_state[0], bell_state[1];

// Entangle the input state with Bell state
CX input_state, bell_state[0];

// Measure and correct
bit m1 = measure input_state;
bit m2 = measure bell_state[0];
if (m2 == true) {
    X bell_state[1];
}
if (m1 == true) {
   Z bell_state[1];
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="deutsch-jozsa">Deutsch-Jozsa</h3>
<p>Let’s implement the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm">Deutsch-Jozsa
algorithm</a> in OpenQASM.</p>
<p>To keep the example small, we work on strings of two bits: <span
class="math inline">n=2</span>. The oracle function <span
class="math inline">f \colon \{0,1\}^2 \to \{0,1\}</span> needs to be
balanced or constant. Let’s choose <span class="math inline">f</span> to
be the XOR function. This is balanced, because as many pairs of bits
have XOR 0 (namely 00 and 11) as have XOR 1 (namely 01 and 10).</p>
<p>To implement the oracle, we have to turn it into a unitary on 3
qubits, that takes <span class="math inline">|x,y,z \rangle</span> to
<span class="math inline">|x,y,z \mathrel\text{ XOR } f(x,y)\rangle =
|x,y,Z \mathrel{\text{ XOR }} (x \mathrel{\text{ XOR }}
Y)\rangle</span>. In other words, we need to find a 3-qubit unitary with
the following truth table on computational basis states.</p>
<table>
<colgroup>

<td style="text-align: center;">0</td>

</table>
<p>We can implement this unitary with two CNOT gates, and hence in
OpenQASM as follows:</p>
<pre><code>gate Oracle x, y, z {
    ctrl @ U(pi, 0, pi) x, z;
    ctrl @ U(pi, 0, pi) y, z;
}   </code></pre>
<p>With the oracle in hand, we can now implement the rest of the
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm as follows: gate CX a, b { ctrl @ U(pi, 0, pi)
a, b; }</p>
<pre><code>gate H a {
   U(pi/2, 0, pi) a;
}

gate X a {
   U(pi, 0, pi) a;
}
    
// declare three qubits
qubit x;
qubit y;
qubit z;

// set the three qubits to |0&gt;, |0&gt;, and |1&gt;
reset x;
reset y;
reset z;
X z;

// apply Hadamard to all three qubits
H x;
H y;
H z;

// apply the oracle
Oracle x, y, z;

// apply Hadamard to the first two qubits
H x;
H y;

// measure the first two qubits
bit a = measure x;
bit b = measure y;</code></pre>
<p>The output bits are <span class="math inline">a=0</span> and <span
class="math inline">b=0</span>, showing that <span
class="math inline">f</span> was indeed balanced.</p>
<h3 id="versions">Versions</h3>
<p>OpenQASM is a standard that has been defined in three different
versions. You can declare which version your code is adhering to by
having the following first line in your code:</p>
<pre><code>OPENQASM 3.0;</code></pre>
<p>OpenQASM 1.0 and 2.0 were mainly developed by IBM. For OpenQASM 2.0
there are several compilers that input OpenQASM code and output a
quantum circuit, not least of which the <a href="#qiskit">Qiskit</a>
suite, which we will discuss next.</p>
<p>OpenQASM 3.0 has been defined and in beta since 2020, and is
undergoing consultation by a wider consortium of stakeholders before
becoming a finalised standard. As of the moment of writing this, support
for OpenQASM 3.0 has not been added to any of the major compilers.
Temporary support is provided to import OpenQASM 3.0 strings into Qiskit
is provided by the Python package <a
href="https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-qasm3-import/"><code>qiskit-qasm3-import</code></a>.</p>
