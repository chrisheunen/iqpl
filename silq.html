<h1 id="silq">SILQ</h1>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>SILQ is a high-level quantum programming language developed by
researchers at ETH Zurich. While it bears some similarity to <a
href="qsharp.html">Q#</a>, it has a number of features that sets it
apart, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sophisticated type system with, among other things, type-level
distinction between classical and quantum types (using <code>!</code>),
classical and quantum subroutines (using the <code>qfree</code>
annotation), and quantum subroutines with and without measurement (using
the <code>mfree</code> annotation);</li>
<li>automatic uncomputation of subroutines, preventing accidental
measurement when variables leave scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>SILQ programs also support using various unicode symbols, though they
all have ASCII alternatives and so are not strictly necessary. In this
tutorial, we will avoid their use.</p>
<p>SILQ programs operate much like Q# programs in that they are allowed
to mix classical and quantum computations, perform measurements at
arbitrary places and branch on the result, and so forth. Unlike
circuits, which are run directly on a quantum computer, we can think of
SILQ programs instead as programs running on a classical computer
<em>controlling</em> a quantum computer: this classical computer is able
to continuously send quantum instructions, as well as the initial
classical data to perform these on, to the quantum computer, and receive
measurements back once the instructions have been executed. This is
known as the <em>QRAM model</em> of quantum computation.</p>
<p>SILQ is most easily installed as a Visual Studio Code plugin, as
described in the <a href="https://silq.ethz.ch/install">installation
instructions</a>, though brave souls can also install it from <a
href="https://github.com/eth-sri/silq">source</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>
<p>Like most other programming languages, a SILQ program consists of a
number of function definitions. A SILQ program is runnable if it
contains a <code>main</code> function. The simplest possible SILQ
program is something like</p>
<pre><code>def main() {
  return false;
}</code></pre>
<p>To run this program in Visual Studio Code, save it and press F5 (it
should return 0).</p>
<p>SILQ supports a number of types and annotations to aid in
programming. The simplest types are the primitive types such as
<code>B</code> (Booleans), <code>N</code> (natural numbers),
<code>Z</code> (integers), <code>int[n]</code> and <code>uint[n]</code>
(<span class="math inline">n</span>-bit signed and unsigned integers),
and so on.</p>
<p>Given some types <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, we can also form
complex types such as <code>s -&gt; t</code> (functions taking inputs of
type <code>s</code> and producing outputs of type <code>t</code>),
<code>s[]</code> (lists of elements of type <code>s</code>),
<code>s^n</code> (for some natural number <code>n</code>; <span
class="math inline">n</span>-ary tuples of type <code>s</code>), and
<code>!s</code> (the type <code>s</code> restricted to classical
values).</p>
<p>While most of these should be self-explanatory, the classical types
<code>!t</code> require some further exposition. A value of type
<code>!t</code> is a value of type <code>t</code> which is guaranteed to
be classical, i.e., not in a superposition of states. Distinguishing
between classical and quantum values is useful, since we can do more
with classical values than quantum ones. For example, classical values
can be thrown away and duplicated, but quantum ones cannot, e.g., the
function</p>
<pre><code>def discard (n : !N) {
  return true;
}</code></pre>
<p>is well-typed (since it is defined only on classical natural
numbers), while the function</p>
<pre><code> def discardQuantum (n : N) {
   return true;
 }</code></pre>
<p>is not (as it would try to discard arbitrary quantum natural numbers,
which is not possible without first measuring). The type of the built-in
measurement function <code>measure</code> also reflects this distinction
between classical and quantum values, in that it has type
<code>t -&gt; !t</code> (for every type <code>t</code>).</p>
<p>It can also be useful to distinguish between functions that measure
(parts of) their input, and functions which do not. A function that does
not measure any (parts of) its arguments can be annotated with the
<code>mfree</code> annotation, and so will not just have type
<code>s -&gt; t</code> but in fact <code>s -&gt; mfree t</code>.
Requiring that an argument function has an <code>mfree</code>-type can
be used to ensure that a superposed quantum state can be safely handed
off to this function without worry that the state is destroyed by a
potential measurement.</p>
<p>A similar annotation is the <code>qfree</code> annotation: a function
of type <code>s -&gt; qfree t</code> is not just a function from
<code>s</code> to <code>t</code>, but one which neither introduces nor
eliminates superpositions. In other words, a <code>qfree</code> function
is a classical function which can be applied to a quantum state without
worry of introducing or eliminating terms in a superposed state. This is
very useful for describing <em>oracles</em> (which are the heart of
algorithms such as Grover search, Deutsch-Jozsa, and many others), as
these are entirely classical functions (and, indeed, these algorithms
only function correctly when they are).</p>
<p>A final very useful type-level feature of SILQ is generic parameters.
A generic parameter is a classical value known at compile-time, on which
a function definition may depend. This can be useful for defining
families of functions which are flexible in that they can be defined
generically for one or more external parameters. For example, one would
expect an algorithm for adding <span class="math inline">n</span>-qubit
quantum integers to work the same for any choice of <span
class="math inline">n</span>, and so such an algorithm should be
<em>generic</em> in <span class="math inline">n</span>. Generic
parameters generalise the <em>uniform families</em> found in <a
href="quipper.html">Quipper</a>. While normal arguments are given in
parentheses, generic parameters are given in square brackets. For
example, the function</p>
<pre><code>def bitwise_not [n:!N] (bits : B^n) qfree {
  for i in [0..n) {
    bits[i] := X(bits[i]);
  }
  return bits;
}</code></pre>
<p>takes a generic parameter <code>n</code> of type <code>!N</code>
(classical natural numbers), and can be applied to a vector of Booleans
of any length (since the input argument <code>bits</code> is of type
<code>B^n</code>, which depends on the generic parameter
<code>n</code>). Whatever the value of the <code>n</code> is, this
function loops through the vector and applies the <span
class="math inline">X</span> gate (or <span
class="math inline">\mathit{NOT}</span> gate) to each entry. This allows
us to apply this same function to vectors of different length, e.g.,
with the definition of <code>bitwise_not</code> above,</p>
<pre><code>def main() {
  xs := bitwise_not(false, false, true);
  ys := bitwise_not(true, true);
  return (xs,ys);
}</code></pre>
<p>is not only well-typed, it also returns <code>((1,1,0),(0,0))</code>
when run as expected.</p>
<p>Note also that <code>bitwise_not</code> can be given the
<code>qfree</code> annotation since all it ever does is apply <span
class="math inline">X</span> to each qubit in the vector, and <span
class="math inline">X</span> neither introduces nor eliminates
superpositions. If we were to change this to apply an arbitrary function
<code>B -&gt; B</code> to each entry in the vector, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>def bitwise_map [n:!N] (bits : B^n, f : !(B -&gt; B)) {
  for i in [0..n) {
    bits[i] := f(bits[i]);
  }
  return bits;
}</code></pre>
<p>we would have to give up the <code>qfree</code> annotation, as we can
not guarantee that <code>f</code> does not introduce or eliminate
superpositions. For example,</p>
<pre><code>def main() {
  xs := bitwise_map((false, true), H);
  return xs;
}</code></pre>
<p>is well-typed (<code>H</code> is the built-in <em>Hadamard</em>
gate), and running it returns the state <span
class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}(\ket{00} + \ket{10} - \ket{01} -
\ket{11})</span>, showing that the SILQ type system was justified in
refusing to award <code>bitwise_map</code> the <code>qfree</code>
annotation.</p>
<p>More information about SILQ (including a complete list of types,
annotations, and other features) can be found in the <a
href="https://silq.ethz.ch/documentation">official
documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="deutsch-jozsa">Deutsch-Jozsa</h3>
<p>An implementation of Deutsch-Jozsa is found below.</p>
<pre><code>def DeutschJozsa[n:!N](const f : B^n -&gt; B^n) {
  // Initialise values.
  state := (0 : int[n]) as B^n;
  state[n] := X(state[n]);

  // Apply Hadamards.
  state := bitwise_map(state, H);

  // Apply oracle.
  state := f(state);

  // Apply Hadamards again.
  state := bitwise_map(state, H);
  state[n] := H(state[n]);

  // Measure and return result.
  return measure(state) == ((0 : int[n]) as B^n);
}</code></pre>
<p>This function returns <code>false</code> if the given function is
constant and <code>true</code> if it is balanced.</p>
