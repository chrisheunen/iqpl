<h1 id="pyzx">PyZX</h1>
<p><a href="pyzx.readthedocs.io/">PyZX</a> is an implementation of the
ZX-calculus. It stands apart from the other quantum programming
environments presented in these tutorials in that it is not intended to
be used to actually program a quantum computer. Rather, it is to be used
as an interface to programmatically manipulate the rules of the
ZX-calculus. As the name suggests, it is written in, and provided as a
package for, the Python programming language. There are other
implementations of the ZX-calculus, such as in <a
href="https://github.com/Quantomatic/quizx">Rust</a> or <a
href="https://juliapackages.com/p/zxcalculus">Julia</a>, but neither are
as feature complete as PyZX. In particular, although the Rust
implementation is considerably faster, it lacks many of the features of
PyZX. In particular, PyZX includes tools for visualizing and
manipulating ZX-diagrams which can be conveniently used inside a Jupyter
notebook.</p>
<p>The ZX-calculus and it’s applications to quantum computation are the
subject of ongoing research, and currently PyZX only implements a rather
limited subset of rewrite rules of the ZX-calculus. These rewrite rules
have been found to be useful in applications, mostly for the
optimisation and compilation of quantum circuits.</p>
<h1 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h1>
<p>PyZX is made available as a PyPi package, which can then be installed
via <code>pip install pyzx</code> and imported as usual:</p>
<pre><code>import pyzx as zx

from fractions import Fraction # Used to described fractional phases</code></pre>
<h2 id="circuits-zx-diagrams">Circuits &amp; ZX-Diagrams</h2>
<p>Quantum circuits are represented in PyZX using the
<code>Circuit</code> class, whose underlying data consist in a list of
gates taken from those defined in PyZX. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>circ = zx.Circuit(3) # The initialisation argument describes the number of qubits in the circuit 

circ.add_gate(&quot;CNOT&quot;, 0, 2)
circ.add_gate(&quot;ZPhase&quot;, 2, phase=Fraction(3,4))
circ.add_gate(&quot;CNOT&quot;, 0, 2)</code></pre>
<p>The gates supported by PyZX are defined in the
<code>pyzx.circuit.gates</code> submodule, and we refer you there for
the auxiliary arguments that must be given for each gate type (or to
calling <code>help(zx.circuit.gates)</code>).</p>
<p>PyZX provides an interface for importing circuits for several of the
other programming languages from these tutorials. In particular, the
<code>Circuit</code> methods <code>from_qasm</code>,
<code>from_quipper</code> make it possible to import circuits from the
OpenQASM 2.0 and Quipper formats respectively. The <code>load</code>
method tries to detect the correct format for an argument filename then
applies the corresponding import method. Lets import one of the circuits
from the Qiskit tutorial:</p>
<pre><code>circ2 = zx.Circuit.from_qasm(&quot;&quot;&quot;
    OPENQASM 2.0;
    include &quot;qelib1.inc&quot;;
    qreg q[4];
    h q[0];
    cx q[0],q[1];
    cx q[3],q[1];
&quot;&quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Note that PyZX does not support the entire OpenQASM 2.0 standard. For
instance, quantum measurements cannot be described in PyZX, and
therefore will not be correctly imported. Of course, PyZX also provides
the corresponding methods for writing a circuit out to these format, in
the form of the <code>to_qasm</code>, <code>to_quipper</code> (and so
on) methods.</p>
<p>PyZX also defines functions for randomly generating circuits.
Unfortunately, these are not all declared in the submodule
<code>__init__.py</code> files, so must be imported individually:</p>
<pre><code>from pyzx.generate import CNOT_HAD_PHASE_circuit

qubits = 3 # number of qubits in the circuit
depth = 5 # number of gates in the circuit

circ3 = CNOT_HAD_PHASE_circuit(qubits, depth, p_had=0.2, p_t=.3)</code></pre>
<p>ZX-diagrams are represented in PyZX by an instance of the
<code>BaseGraph</code> class, the underlying data of which consist in a
simple graph along with some additional data on vertices. Specifically,
the vertices are labelled by (not necessarily contiguous) integrers, and
there are four types vertices: Z-spiders, X-spiders, H-boxes, and
boundaries (which represent either an input or an output of the
diagram). The type of a vertex is given by an integer, whose value is
defined in <code>pyzx.utils.VertexType</code> by the constants
<code>VertexType.BOUNDARY</code>, <code>VertexType.Z</code>,
<code>VertexType.X</code>, and <code>VertexType.H</code>.</p>
<p><strong>A note on backends</strong>: In fact, <code>BaseGraph</code>
is a “shell” class that merely defines the interface that any ZX-diagram
class must implement in PyZX. There are a number of different backend
implementations provided in the <code>pyzx.graph</code> submodule. The
current default is <code>GraphS</code>, a purely Pythonic implementation
of the interface. The <code>zx.Graph()</code> function constructs an
instance of an implementation of <code>BaseGraph</code>, currently
<code>GraphS</code>.</p>
<p>To construct an empty ZX-diagram, we write:</p>
<pre><code>diagram = zx.Graph()</code></pre>
<p>We can add vertices to the graph using the <code>add_vertex</code>
and <code>add_vertices</code> methods, which furthermore return the
indices of the newly-created vertices:</p>
<pre><code>diagram.add_vertices(3)</code></pre>
<p>We can then set the type and phase (if necessary) of a vertex as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>for vertex in range(0, 3):
    diagram.set_type(vertex, zx.VertexType.Z)
diagram.set_phase(0, Fraction(2,3)) # The second argument is a fraction of 2 * pi</code></pre>
<p>We can check the type of a vertex with:</p>
<pre><code>print(diagram.type(2) == zx.VertexType.Z)</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, we can add edges to the graph using:</p>
<pre><code>diagram.add_edge((0,1)) # Adds an edge between vertices 0 and 1
diagram.add_edge((1,2)) # Adds an edge between vertices 1 and 2</code></pre>
<p>However, this isn’t really the “standard” way to instantiate a
ZX-diagram. It’s much more common to obtain one from a quantum circuit
of interest, and PyZX of course provides a method to do so. To convert
our circuit to a diagram, we write:</p>
<pre><code>circ_diagram = circ.to_graph()</code></pre>
<p>We can then visualise the diagram with:</p>
<pre><code>zx.draw(circ_diagram)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/png/pyzx_diagram1.png" /></p>
<p>An interactive visualisation can be obtained using the PyZX graph
editor. The editor can be used to manipulate vertices of the diagram,
apply rewrite rules or even arbitrary edits to the diagram:</p>
<pre><code>zx.editor.edit(circ_diagram)</code></pre>
<p>Click “Save snapshot” to save the result back into
<code>circ_diagram</code>. Within the PyZX editor, you will note that we
can also apply some of the ZX-calculus rewrite rules to our diagram.
Let’s next see how we can do this programmatically.</p>
<h2 id="applying-rewrites">Applying rewrites</h2>
<p>The syntax for applying a result is a little complex. Rewrites are
applied by calling the <code>zx.simplify.simp</code> function, which
takes 4 non-optional arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the diagram <code>diagram</code> to apply the rewrites to;</li>
<li>a string <code>name</code>, which simply describes a name to
display;</li>
<li>a function <code>match</code>, which finds <em>non-intersecting</em>
matches in <code>diagram</code> of the LHS of the rewrite rule to
apply;</li>
<li>a function <code>rewrite</code>, which rewrites each match to the
RHS of the rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rewrite rules that were available in the editor all have
<code>match</code> and <code>rewrite</code> functions which are
described in the <code>pyzx.rules</code> submodule. These each come in a
version that finds a single match, and a version that tries to find as
many <em>non-overlapping</em> matches in the diagram as possible, dubbed
“parallel” versions.</p>
<p>Let’s apply the spider fusion rule to the following simple
diagram:</p>
<pre><code>circ4 = zx.Circuit(1) # The initialisation argument describes the number of qubits in the circuit 

circ4.add_gate(&quot;ZPhase&quot;, 0, Fraction(1/2))
circ4.add_gate(&quot;ZPhase&quot;, 0, Fraction(1/2))

circ_diagram4 = circ4.to_graph()</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/png/pyzx_diagram2.png" /></p>
<pre><code>zx.simplify.simp(circ_diagram4, &quot;spider&quot;, zx.simplify.match_spider, zx.simplify.spider)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/png/pyzx_diagram3.png" /></p>
<p>Now, if you peruse the content of <code>pyzx.simplify</code> (for
intance with <code>help(zx.simplify)</code>), you will notice that the
set of rewrites defined is very incomplete, and also includes some
rather unfamiliar rewrites. This is partly because only rewrites which
have proved useful in practice have been implemented, and partly because
of the issue of circuit extraction.</p>
<h2 id="extracting-circuits-from-diagrams">Extracting circuits from
diagrams</h2>
<p>It is easy to turn a quantum circuit into a ZX-diagram and apply
rewrite rules. However, once these rewrites have been applied it can be
very complicated to extract a quantum circuit from the resulting
diagram, short of reversing all of the rewrites and returning to the
original circuit. In fact, it was <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09194">recently proved</a> that
extracting circuits from an arbitrary ZX-diagram (one not necessarily
obtained from a circuit in the first place) can be #P-hard, even under
the promise that such a circuit exists.</p>
<p>In order to avoid this difficulty, one carefully applies rewrites to
a diagram which are known to preserve some global property of the
diagram which guarantees extractability. For example, “causal flow” is a
graph-theoretic property originally defined for reasoning about
measurement-based quantum computations (MBQC). When applied to
ZX-diagram, it guarantees that the ZX-diagram can be interpreted as such
an MBQC for which a circuit extraction is known. The problem of finding
such rewrite rules is still very much the topic of ongoing research, and
goes beyond the remit of these notes.</p>
<p>These rewrite strategies are assembled into simplification strategies
for quantum circuits, also defined in <code>pyzx.simplify</code>. The
main ones are <code>clifford_simp</code> and <code>full_reduce</code>.
Let’s apply <code>clifford_simp</code> to simplify one of our
circuits:</p>
<pre><code>zx.clifford_simp(circ_diagram)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/png/pyzx_diagram4.png" /></p>
<p>This is clearly not a circuit, but we can extract a PyZX
<code>Circuit</code> using:</p>
<pre><code>simplified_circuit = zx.extract_circuit(circ_diagram)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/png/pyzx_diagram5.png" /></p>
<h1 id="deutsch-jozsa-algorithm">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</h1>
<p>Let’s import the (unitary part of) the Deutsch-Jozsa quantum circuit
we gave in the OpenQASM and Qiskit tutorials:</p>
<pre><code>dj_circ = zx.Circuit.from_qasm(&quot;&quot;&quot;
OPENQASM 2.0;
include &quot;qelib1.inc&quot;;
qreg q[4];
creg c[3];
h q[0];
h q[1];
h q[2];
x q[3];
h q[3];
x q[0];
x q[2];
barrier q[0],q[1],q[2],q[3];
cx q[0],q[3];
cx q[1],q[3];
cx q[2],q[3];
barrier q[0],q[1],q[2],q[3];
x q[0];
x q[2];
h q[0];
h q[1];
h q[2];
barrier q[0],q[1],q[2],q[3];
measure q[0] -&gt; c[0];
measure q[1] -&gt; c[1];
measure q[2] -&gt; c[2];
&quot;&quot;&quot;).to_graph()</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/png/pyzx_dj1.png" /></p>
<p>As announced, <code>from_qasm</code> ignores the the classical parts
when importing the circuit. We can then appy an optimisation routine,
then extract a circuit back out:</p>
<pre><code>zx.clifford_simp(dj_circ)
optimisied_circuit = zx.extract_circuit(dj_circ)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/png/pyzx_dj2.png" /></p>
<p>Now, it might not be apparent from such a small circuit, but the
optimisation ideas underlying <code>clifford_simp</code> have proven
very effective when the circuits get much larger. It’s also worth
pointing that this example might be somewhat unnatural: we are
optimising not just the circuit for implementing Deutsch-Jozsa, but also
the circuit that implements the oracle for the input function
<code>f</code>.</p>
